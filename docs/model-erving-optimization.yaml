# Performance optimizations:
- Model caching with Redis
- Request batching for GPU inference
- Async processing for non-critical paths
- Connection pooling for database access
- Circuit breakers for dependent services

# Resource optimization:
- Vertical Pod Autoscaler for right-sizing
- Horizontal Pod Autoscaler for load-based scaling
- Node affinity for GPU workloads
- Resource quotas for cost control
